### DQN implementation notes

TODO:
First I need the preprocessing function phi, for stacking m frames, gray scaling them, and reshaping them.
Then build out model as described in paper.
Then set up dummy training loop with simple hyperparams to make sure it behaves correctly on a small scale.
Then set up recordings and do a full scale training and hope it works.
